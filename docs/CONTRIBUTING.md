## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   Create your own fork of [Muziso on GitHub](https://github.com/xtros/Muziso).

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```

3. **Code Style Standards**:
   - **Frontend**: Follow React 19 functional component standards, TypeScript strict typing, and Framer Motion transitions.
   - **Styling**: Maintain the signature cyber-minimal dark palette (`#09090b` background, `#ccff00` neon accent).
   - **Backend**: Adhere to standard Rust code formatting (`cargo fmt`) and check for warnings (`cargo check`, `cargo clippy`).
   - **Deduplication Rules**: Use `getSmartDedupKey` / `clean_dedup_key` for version-preserving song deduplication.

4. **Submit Your PR**:
   Push to your branch and open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch. Provide a brief summary of what changes were made and how to test them.
